Overview

It’s a sunny early summer morning. The Austrian Alps are waking up  and  with  them,  countless  hikers  are 
getting ready to explore the majestic mountains. Mountain rescue teams know, that today might be a busy 
day and because of that are on standby, as always. The phone rings: A hiker is injured, has lost orientation, 
and cannot accurately provide their location. Depending on the severity of the injury, every minute counts, 
yet searching in steep, forested, or foggy terrain is difficult and time-consuming. 
The rescue teams face a real challenge: 
The exact position of the hiker is often unclear. Traditional rescue teams  have to search large areas, often 
even by helicopter, which not only results in high costs but also impacts the environment. Many hikers even 
hesitate  to  call  for  help,  fearing  that  this  will  result  in  a  major  rescue  operation,  possibly  involving  a 
helicopter. This leads injured people to question “Is my injury really that bad? Maybe I can make it down to 
the valley myself and go to the hospital afterwards?” As a result, rescue operations are often unnecessarily 
delayed or not started at all. 
Time for a change: 
The Mountain Rescue in Tyrol wants a smarter solution. They commission a startup of creative minds to 
develop a drone rescue system that will support both rescue teams and hikers. 
Their Vision: 
• When a call for help (doesn’t have to be an actual phone call) is received, a drone is launched and 
uses modern sensors and intelligent software to quickly and accurately locate the injured person. 
• There might even be a solution where hikers can share their exact location easily?! 
• The system should work reliably even in poor visibility and difficult terrain like wind, fog, etc. 
• Because  many  mountain  rescuers  are  volunteers,  and  different  people  might  operate  the  system 
each day, the solution needs to be simple and easy to use. 
• It is essential that the drone can (also) be operated manually. 
• The solution must be affordable and cost-effective for both users and operators. 
With  a  drone  system  like  this,  searching  for  injured  hikers  becomes  much  faster  and  cheaper.  It  saves 
important resources and makes it easier for people to ask for help. Rescue missions become smarter, more 
sustainable, and more caring.
