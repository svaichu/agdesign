Constraints (Non-Functional Requirements):
R-01 (Must): Deliver a confirmed human coordinate within 15 minutes of distress receipt for a typical search cell; provide incremental updates as localization confidence improves.
R-02 (Must): Achieve sub-meter (0.1–2 m) accuracy in spoting the injured hiker.
R-04 (Must): Remain operable in forested alpine conditions (canopy, multipath, fog/dusk) with edge processing to avoid cloud dependency.
R-05 (Must): Provide manual override and safe-state behaviors (hover/RTL) for any drone at any time; fail safe on link loss or degraded sensors.
R-06 (Should): Minimize cost, power draw, and environmental impact by preferring COTS hardware, efficient compute, and quiet profiles suitable for volunteer rescue teams.
R-07 (Should): Support optional emergency payload drop or sustained hover observation without compromising primary comms/relay duties.
